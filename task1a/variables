add5,add6,addr0,addr1- on the bss- because their global variables out of any function or static
foo() ,point_at- initialized data under bss
i-stack,addr2,add3.addr4 poimting to the heap,iarray ,carray, iarrayptr,carrayptr,p,local
yos- on stack pointing to word in the initilized data  
distances:addr5-addr6=4 cause they close on bss
local-addr5= big difference stack and bss
foo-addr5 tiny difference nss and uninitilized
